# Forecasting-Warner-Music-Group-Stock-Prices-Using-ARIMA

# Introduction 

**1. Objective:** The goal of this project is to forecast the future revenue of Warner Music Group (WMG) using historical financial data.

**2. Significance:** Accurate revenue forecasting can help in strategic planning, budgeting, and investment decisions for companies and stakeholders.


# Problem Defination

With the increasing competition in the music industry, it's crucial for Warner Music Group to anticipate revenue trends and prepare accordingly. This project aims to develop a forecasting model that predicts future revenue based on past performance.


# Project Steps

**Step 1: Data Preparation**

**1. Loading Data:** Read the WMG revenue data from the provided Excel file.

**2. Exploration:** Analyze the data to understand its structure, check for missing values, and perform initial data cleaning.


**Step 2: Feature Engineering**

**1. Time Features:** Extract relevant time-based features, such as Year and Quarter.

**2. Lag Features:** Create lagged revenue features to help the model learn from past performance.


**Step 3: Splitting Data**

**Train-Test Split:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.


**Step 4: Data Scaling**

**Normalization:** Scale the revenue data for better model performance using techniques like StandardScaler.


**Step 5: Model Selection**

**Choose a Forecasting Model:** For this project, you can use models like ARIMA, LSTM, or a simple linear regression model.


**Step 6: Forecasting**

**Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to forecast future revenue and evaluate it against the test data.


**Step 7: Evaluation**

**Metrics:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE).


**Step 8:** Data Visualization

**Visualize Results:** Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to plot the actual vs. predicted revenue.


# Results

**Forecast Accuracy:** Summarize the accuracy of the forecasting model using the selected metrics.

**Visual Insights:** Provide graphs showing the actual and predicted revenue trends over time.


# Conclusion

**Summary:** Recap the forecasting process, the performance of the model, and the insights gained from the analysis.

**Future Work:** Discuss potential improvements, such as using more complex models or additional data sources.
